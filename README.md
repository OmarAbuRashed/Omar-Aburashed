This project is a simple webpage introducing the field of subsea engineering. It explains what subsea engineering is, why it is important, and highlights the key technologies used under the ocean. The webpage was first created in CodePen as part of Step 4 of the ITD curriculum, then exported and uploaded to GitHub Pages.
