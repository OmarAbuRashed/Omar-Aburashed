  <h1>Subsea Engineering</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p id="the-first-paragraph"> Subsea engineering is a specialised branch of offshore engineering that focuses on designing, installing, and maintaining equipment and infrastructure beneath the ocean’s surface. It plays a crucial role in offshore energy production, especially in the oil and gas industry, where engineers work with systems placed thousands of meters underwater.</p>

<p id="the-second-paragraph">Subsea engineers must understand advanced technologies such as remotely operated vehicles (ROVs), dynamic positioning, and high-pressure equipment that can survive extreme underwater conditions. The field also increasingly supports renewable energy, including offshore wind and tidal systems. Subsea engineering is challenging but rewarding, combining innovation, problem-solving, and global-scale environmental responsibility.</p>
